CMN-codes
=========

A small preview of codes I use for working with Croatian Meteor Network.

  * ## FF_bin_suite 
  
  Required for using [CMN_bin_viewer](http://cmn.rgn.hr/binviewer/binviewer.html) software: 
  It is a collection of functions and examples how to work with CAMS standard *.bin files (rading the format and building individual frames).
  It also contains optimized functions for image processing such as levels adjustment, dark frame subtraction, flat fielding, image stacking, etc.
  

  * ## antialiasing 
    
  A test project I used to introduce myself to image processing with python. It is a slow and non-optimized brute-force approach and uses loops. A very bad code indeed.
  I don't have any intention to improve it, as it was just a quick introductory exercise. Use at your own risk.
